# SimplePasswordManager
A simple way to store your passwords without requiring third party applications

Simple To Use. Store Your Passwords For Each Websites You Visit

when creating an account with a website, it has an option for generating random strong passwords

The next time you visit a site whose information you saved to the application, just type the name of the website and search it, it will bring you a prompt that your password
has been copied to the clipboard and your work will be to paste and login to your desired site.

The data is stored automatically in a json file within your local host

1. No need of a third party application software which may bring trust issues with some clients
2. It is very simple to use
